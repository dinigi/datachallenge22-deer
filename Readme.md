## Abstract 
<!-- (50-60 words) -->

## Research Questions
Do the animals show site fidelity (territorial behaviour)? If yes, what is their home range (revisited area)?  

## Results / products
Describing each animals home range and visualizing it on a map

## Data
Roe Deer Movement Data: Location + Date & time

## Analytical concepts
- Site fidelity: Linearity index & Mean Squared Distance (MSD)
- Home range: Jennrich-Turner method

## R concepts
- adehabitatLT: tools for wildlife trajectories
- adehabitatHR: tools for working out speciesâ€™ home ranges
- adehabitatHS: tools for exploring habitat suitability
- adehabitatMA: tools for mapping data concerning species

## Risk analysis
If the animals do not show territorial behaviour then there won't be a home range. Also it will be important to see wether the tracks are regular or irregular. In this case I would maybe focus on visualizing/animating the movement data to find other interesting patterns.

## Questions? 
I'm sure something will come up :)
