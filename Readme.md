## Abstract 
I'm interested in visualizing which areas the individual animals return to the most and how these "core areas" might change over time.

## Research Questions
Do the animals show site fidelity (territorial behaviour)? If yes, what is their core area (location they revisit the most)?  

## Results / products
Describing each animals home range and visualizing it on a map

## Data
Roe Deer Movement Data: Location + Date & time

## Analytical concepts
- Site fidelity: Linearity index & Mean Squared Distance (MSD)
- Home range: Jennrich-Turner method

## R concepts
- adehabitatLT: tools for wildlife trajectories (https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2018-03-12/web/packages/adehabitatLT/vignettes/adehabitatLT.pdf)
- adehabitatHR: tools for working out speciesâ€™ home ranges
- adehabitatHS: tools for exploring habitat suitability
- adehabitatMA: tools for mapping data concerning species

## Risk analysis
If the data is very irregular it could be problematic and i would then rather focus on visualizing/animating the movements to find other interesting patterns of behaviour

## Questions? 
I'm sure questions will come up :)
